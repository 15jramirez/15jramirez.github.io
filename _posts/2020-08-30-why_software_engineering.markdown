Growing up, I always liked computers. I would be the one messing with them. Eventually, I even ended up breaking the first family computer because of how bad I played around it - whoops sorry mom!

Funny enough, it was not when I was little that I decided that I want to be a software engineer. I went to college and didn't know what I wanted to be. It was up until my senior year when I took a coding class to fulfill my extra credit requirement. I took a web development class, and soon I found my self taking a intro to c++ course. Despite the struggles such as hating my program for it to run after realizing I accidentally added a period in the wrong spot, I loved it all. 

That was my moment where I just knew I have found something that I was happy and passionate about. 
Incoming nerd alert- but I get all excited talking about code to someone. I love how with just a few lines I can tell a computer to do so much from taking in names for a line like in the Deli Lab to simply outputting your name. 
 
Now, that was how I got into coding, but haven't necessarily answered why software engineering. I chose software engineering because I want to be that person to help out putting others' creations to life. It is amazing to work with another department and help them create their ideas Even more, not only I am that person that can help, but I am also helping to fix errors that occur in other programs. I like that how it is always going to be a puzzle that I have to figure out to solve. It combines my like for coding, for helping others, and for creating.
